This level requires us to hijack the traffic of a remote host by configuring our network interface. The remote host `10.0.0.4` is trying to communicate with `10.0.0.2` at port `31337`. We can configure our network interface to set the IP address to `10.0.0.2` and listen to the remote host's traffic.

We can list the network interfaces on our computer through the following commands:

```bash
ifconfig
ip addr show
ip addr show dev eth0
```

It looks like our host has 1 network interface `eth0` with the IP address `10.0.0.3`. We can configure this interface and add an extra IP address to this interface by using the `ip addr` command.

```bash
ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth0
```

Now we can listen on port `31337` to see what `10.0.0.4` was communicating.

```bash
nc -lvp 31337
```

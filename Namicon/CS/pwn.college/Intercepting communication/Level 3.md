This requires us to find a remote host within a network and connect to it via port `31337`. So we need to scan the entire network and see which host is up and running. We can use `nmap` with the flag `-sP`, which allows us to perform a ping scan, meaning we won't do a port scan after host discovery.

```bash
nmap -sP 10.0.0.0/24
```

Once we've found a host that's running, we can try to connect to that host via port `31337`.

```bash
nc 10.0.0.25 31337
```

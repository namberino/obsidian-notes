Now we need to statically respond to an HTTP request. For this, we need to read the request from the accepted connection into a buffer and return a response. We need to utilize the [read syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) and the [write syscall](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html).

The `read` syscall takes in 3 parameters: the file descriptor to read from, the pointer to a buffer to read to, and the count, which is the size of the buffer. It will return the number of bytes read on success.

The `write` syscall takes in 3 parameters. The same parameters as the `read` syscall. It will write the data from the buffer, with the count parameter specifying how many bytes to write. 

So first, we need to initialize the response message:

```asm
.section .rodata
response_msg:
    .string "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n\r\n\0"
```

This is the read-only data section, and it contains the response message which has also been null terminated.

Now we need to allocate a read buffer to be used for the `read` syscall. The GNU assembler has a directive called `.skip` which allows us to allocate some memory:

```asm
read_buffer:
    .skip 1024
```

Now we just need to invoke the 2 syscalls with the correct parameters and we're good:

```asm
mov rdi, r9     # get accepted socket fd
lea rsi, read_buffer
mov rdx, 1024   # buffer size
mov rax, 0      # sys_read
syscall

mov rdi, r9     # get accepted socket fd
lea rsi, response_msg
mov rdx, 19
mov rax, 1      # sys_write
syscall
```

Since the response message is 19 bytes long (not counting the null terminating character), we set count = 19 for the `write` syscall. And the buffer was initialized to 1024 bytes so we set the count = 1024 for the `read` syscall.

Both the `read` and `write` syscall was performed on the accepted socket file descriptor, so it basically reads the request that the client makes to that socket's file descriptor, and write the response to that socket's file descriptor, which will return to the client.

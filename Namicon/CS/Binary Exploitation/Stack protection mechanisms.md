- *RELRO*: Refers to the read/writability of the Global Offset Table (GOT). If we have "FULL RELRO", the GOT will be marked as read-only, and we will not be able to overwrite entries.
- *Stack Canaries*: If canaries are enabled, they will be assigned a random value and placed on the stack at the beginning of a function. Before the function returns (where return-value-buffer-overflow would occur), it will first check that the canary still equals the random value assigned at the beginning. If we've overwritten the return address, we must have overwritten the canary to reach it so the program will crash with a message "stack smashing detected".
- *NX/DEP*: When No-eXecute (NX) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled, values on the stack are marked as DATA, so any input we inject onto the stack will be marked as data. If we inject some shellcode onto the stack, it won't be executable.
- *PIE*: If Position Independent Executables is enabled, the program will have a different base memory address each time the program loads. Consider the Ret2Win attack; we overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with the address of a `win` function. If PIE is enabled, we won't find that address by analyzing the binary. We could see the offset to that function from the program's base address, but we need to leak an address to calculate the base.
- *RWX*: Indicates whether the binary has writeable and executable segments at the same time.

Malware falls into several categories:

> A backdoor is malicious code that embeds itself into a computer to allow a remote attacker access (with little to no authority) to execute various commands on any respective local computer

> A botnet allows an attacker access to a system. However, it receives instructions from not a remote attacker but from a command-and-control server, which can control an unlimited amount of computers at the same time

> A downloader is malicious code that installs other malicious software. It is usually installed when a hacker initially gains access to a system. The downloader then installs additional software to control the system

> Information access malware gathers information from the computer and sends it to a host (keylogger, password grabber). Usually used to obtain access to online accounts

> There are malicious program that launch other malicious program which use non-standard options to get elevated access or a better cloaking technique when penetrating a system

> rootkit is one of the most dangerous form of malware. it hides itself and additional malwares. It can manipulate processes (such as hiding their IP in an IP scan so the user can never detect it)

> Scareware tricks a user into purchasing software to falsely protect themselves, when in reality, there's no real threat. Once the user pays to have the tricked software removed from the computer it then can stay resident and later emerge in an altered form

> There are also various kinds of malware that send spam from a target machine which generates income for the attacker by allowing them to sell various services to other users

> The final form of malware is that of a traditional worm or virus which copies itself and goes after other computers

- When a program starts to execute, a certain contiguous section of memory is set aside for the program called the stack
- The stack pointer is a register that contains the top of the stack. The stack pointer contains the smallest address (example: 0x00001000. Any address smaller than 0x00001000 is considered garbage and any address greater than 0x00001000 is considered valid)
![[stack-address.png]]
- The stack grows downward from higher memory to lower memory

- The stack bottom is the largest valid address of the stack and is located in the larger address area or top of the memory model (stack bottom is higher in memory)
- The stack limit is the smallest valid address of the stack. If the stack pointer gets smaller than this, there's a stack overflow which can corrupt a program, allowing an attacker to take control of a system

- There are two operations on the stack which are push and pop. You can push one or more registers by setting the stack pointer to a smaller value. This is usually done by subtracting four times the number of registers to be pushed onto the stack and copying the registers to the stack
- You can pop one or more registers by copying the data from the stack to the registers, then add a value to the stack pointer. This is usually done by adding four times the number of registers to be popped on the stack

- For each function call there is a section of the stack reserved for the function. This is called the stack frame

- Example: unreachableFunction
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void unreachableFunction(void)
{
	printf("This is a hidden function\n");
	exit(0);
}

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hello world\n");

	return 0;
}
```

- There's 2 functions here. main function will always be executed so it will get added onto the stack

- Stack frame for int main(void):
![[unreachablefunction-stack.png]]

- Referred to as activation record. A stack frame exists whenever a function has started but hasn't completed

- Example: addMe
![[addme.jpg]]
- Inside main, there's a call to addMe. So there needs to be assembly code in the main function to push the arguments for int addMe(int a, int b) onto the stack

![[addMe-compiled.jpg]]

- int main(void) calls int addMe(int a, int b) first and will get put on the stack:
![[addme-stack.jpg]]

- By placing the arguments on the stack, the stack frame for int main(void) has increased in size
- We also reserved space for the return value computed by int addMe(int a, int b) and when the function returns, the return value in int main(void) gets restored and execution continues in int main(void) until it finishes

- Once we get to the instructions for int addMe(int a, int b), the function may need local variables so the function needs to push some space on the stack:
![[addme-func-stack.jpg]]

- FP is the frame pointer that points to the location where the stack pointer was just before int addMe() moved the stack pointer or SP for addMe()'s own local variables
- The use of a frame pointer is essential when a function is likely to move the stack pointer several times throughout the course of running the function
- The idea is to keep the frame pointer fixed for the duration of int addMe()â€™s stack frame. In the meantime, the stack pointer can change values

- We can use the frame pointer to compute the locations in memory for both arguments as well as local variables. Since it does not move, the computations for those locations should be some fixed offset from the frame pointer

- Once it's time to exit the addMe function, the stack pointer is set to where the frame pointer is which pops off the addMe stack frame

- Note (addMe): 
	- The stack pointer (ESP), when examined in memory on a breakpoint on the main function, lists 0xffffd050
	- When the program calls the addMe function from main, it adds the addMe function to the call stack, ESP is now 0xffffd030 which is **LOWER** in memory. So the stack grows downward 



- *Summary*: The stack is a special region of memory that stores temporary variables created by each function including main. The stack is LIFO. It is managed and optimized by the CPU. Every time a function declares a new variable, it's pushed onto the stack. Every time a function exits, all of the variables pushed onto the stack by that function are freed or deleted. Once a stack variable is freed, that region of memory becomes available for other stack variables
- *Advantage*: The memory is managed by you. You don't have to allocate memory or free it manually. The CPU manages and organizes the stack. 

- When a function exits, all of its variables are popped off the stack and lost forever
- The stack variables are local. The stack grows and shrinks as functions push and pop local variables

- Flags help control, check, and verify program execution. They determine whether each operation performed by the processor is successful or not
- Flags are critical to assembly language applications as they are a check to verify each programs functions successful execution
- EFLAGS is a 32-bit register that contains a group of status, control and system flags (contains 32-bit info mapped to represent specific flags information)

- There are 3 kinds of flags (status flags, control flags, system flags)

- Status flags:
		- **CF**: Carry flag
		- **PF**: Parity Flag
		- **AF**: Adjust Flag
		- **ZF**: Zero Flag
		- **SF**: Sign Flag
		- **OF**: Overflow Flag
	- **The carry flag** is set when a math operation on an unsigned integer generates a carry or borrow for the most significant bit. This is an overflow condition for the register involved in the math operation. When this occurs, the remaining data in the register is not the correct answer to the math operation
	- **The parity flag** is used to indicate corrupt data as a result of a math operation in a register. When checked, the parity flag is set if the total number of 1 bits in the result is even and is cleared if the total number of 1 bits in the result is odd. When the parity flag is checked, an application can determine whether the register has been corrupted since the operation
	- **The adjust flag** is used in Binary Coded Decimal math operations and is set if a carry or borrow operation occurs from bit 3 of the register used for the calculation
	- **The zero flag** is set if the result of an operation is zero
	- **The sign flag** is set to the most significant bit of the result (which is the sign bit) and indicates whether the result is positive or negative
	- **The overflow flag** is used in signed integer arithmetic when a positive value is too big or a negative value is too small to be represented in the register

- Control flags: Used to control specific behavior in the processor. The DF flag (direction flag) is used to control the way strings are handled by the processor
- When set, string instructions automatically decrement memory addresses to get the next byte of the string
- When cleared, string instructions automatically increment memory addresses to get the next byte of the string

- System flags: Used to control OS level operations which should **NEVER** be modified by any respective program or application
	- **TF**: Trap flag
	- **IF**: Interrupt enable flag
	- **IOPL**: I/O privilege level flag
	- **NT**: Nested task flag
	- **RF**: Resume flag
	- **VM**: Virtual-8086 mode flag
	- **AC**: Alignment check flag
	- **VIF**: Virtual interrupt flag
	- **VIP**: Virtual interrupt pending flag
	- **ID**: Identification flag
	- **The trap flag**: Set to enable single-step mode. When in this mode the processor performs only one instruction code at a time, waiting for a signal to perform the next instruction. This is essential when debugging
	- **The interrupt enable flag**: Controls how the processor responds to signals received from external sources
	- **The I/O privilege field**: Indicates the input-output privilege level of the currently running task and defines access levels for the input-output address space which must be less than or equal to the access level required to access the respective address space. In case it is not less than or equal to the access level required, any request to access the address space will be denied
	- **The nested task flag**: Controls whether the currently running task is linked to the previously executed task and is used for chaining interrupted and called tasks
	- **The resume flag**: Controls how the processor responds to exceptions when in debugging mode
	- **The VM flag**: indicates that the processor is operating in virtual-8086 mode instead of protected or real mode
	- **The alignment check flag**: Used in conjunction with the AM bit in the CR0 control register to enable alignment checking of memory references
	- **The virtual interrupt flag**: Replicates the IF flag when the processor is operating in virtual mode
	- **The virtual interrupt pending flag**: Used when the processor is operating in virtual mode to indicate that n interrupt is pending
	- **The ID flag**: Indicates whether the processor supports the CPUID instruction

### Def: 
- x86 assembly language is a family of backward-compatible assembly languages which provide compatibility with the Intel 8000 series of microprocessors
- This assembly language works with a variety of operating system

- It has 2 choices of syntax: AT&T syntax (usually Unix) and Intel syntax (usually MS-DOS and Windows)
- Main difference:
	- AT&T syntax: source comes before the destination
	- Intel syntax: source comes after the destination

- We'll focus on the 32-bit architecture as most malwares will be written for (Because they need to be able to infect as many systems as possible and 32-bit malwares/softwares will work on 64-bit systems)

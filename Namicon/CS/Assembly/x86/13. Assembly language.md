- Most malwares are written in higher-level languages however most malware writers do not give the attackers their source code so they can properly deal with their crafted attack
- The hackers use a multitude of high-level languages. The demand for new professional Malware Analyst Reverse Engineers continue to grow daily
- When we examine malware, more than not we get only a compiled binary. The only thing we can do with a compiled binary is to break it down, instruction-by-instruction, in Assembly Language (as **EVERYTHING** ultimately goes down to Assembly Language)

- Understanding Assembly Language allows one to open a debugger on an a running process
- Each running program has a PID, which is a numerical value which designates a running program
- If we open a running process or any bit of malware with a professional or open-source tool like GDB, we can see **EXACTLY** what is going on and then use the EIP instruction pointer to go where we need it to go to have **COMPLETE** control over program flow

- Most malware is written, as I have stated, in a middle-level language and once compiled it can be read by the hardware or OS as it is not human-readable. In order for professional cybersecurity engineers to understand this, they must learn to read, write and properly debug assembly

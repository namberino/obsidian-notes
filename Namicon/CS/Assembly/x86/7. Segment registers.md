- The segment registers are used specifically for referencing memory locations. There are 3 methods of accessing system memory (we focus on flat memory)

- There are 6 segment registers:
	- **CS**: The `code segment` register stores the base location of the code section ($.text$ section) which is used for data access
	- **DS**: The data segment register stores the default location for variables ($.data$ section) which is used for data access
	- **ES**: The extra segment register which is used during string operations
	- **SS**: The stack segment register stores the base location of the stack segment and is used when we implicitly use the stack pointer or when we explicitly use the base pointer
	- **FS**: The extra segment register
	- **GS**: The extra segment register

- Each segment register is 16-bit and contains the pointer to the start of the memory-specific segment.
- The code segment is where the instruction codes are stored in memory
- The processor retrieves instruction codes from memory based on the CS register value and an offset value contained in the instruction pointer (**EIP**) register
- *Note*: No program can explicitly load or change the CS register. The processor assign its values as the program is assigned a memory place

- The DS, ES, FS and GS segment registers are used to point to data segments. 
- Each segments help the program separate data elements to ensure they have no overlap. The program loads the data segment registers with the appropriate pointer value for the segments and reference individual memory locations using an offset value
- The stack segment register (SS) is used to point to the stack segment. The stack contains data values passed to functions and procedures within the program

- Segment registers are considered a part of the operating system and can neither read nor be changed directly in almost all cases
- When working in the protected mode flat model (x86 architecture which is 32-bit), the program runs and receives a 4GB address space that any 32-bit registers can potentially address (any of the 4 billion memory location except for the protected area defined by the OS)
- Physical memory may be larger than 4GB however a 32-bit register can only express 4,294,967,296 different locations
- If the computer have more than 4GB of memory, the OS must arrange a 4GB region within the memory and your programs are limited to that new region

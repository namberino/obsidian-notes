There are 2 basic malware analysis techniques: static and dynamic analysis

**Static analysis**: use software tools to examine executable without running the actual decompiled instruction in assembly

**Dynamic analysis**: use disassemblers and debuggers to analyze malware binaries while actually running them

The most popular tool is *IDA* (multi-platform, multi-processor disassembler and debugger)

A disassembler will convert executable binaries written in assembly, C, C++, etc into assembly language instructions that we can debug and manipulate

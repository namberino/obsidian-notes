- There are 5 control registers used to determine the operating mode of the CPU and the characteristics of the current executing task:
	- **CR0**: A system flag that controls the operating mode and various states of the processor
	- **CR1**: Reserved. This register is not currently implemented
	- **CR2**: Memory page fault information
	- **CR3**: Memory page directory information
	- **CR4**: Flags that enable processor feathers and indicate feature capabilities of the processor

- The value in each control registers can't be directly accessed. However, the data in the control registers can be moved to 1 of the general purpose registers. 
- Once data is in a GP register, a program can examine the bit flags in the register to determine the operating status of the processor in conjunction with the current running task
- If a change is required to a control register flag value, the change can be made to the data in the GP register and the register moved to the CR
- Normal application programs do not usually modify control register entries however they might query flag values to determine the capabilities of the host processor chip on which the program is currently running

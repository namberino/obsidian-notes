- Contrary to the stack, the heap grows upward
![[heap-diagram.jpg]]

- The heap is the region of your computer's memory that is not managed automatically for you, and is not as tightly managed by the CPU. It is a free-floating region of memory and is larger than the stack allocation of memory
- To allocate memory on the heap, use malloc() or calloc(). Once the memory is allocated, we need to use free() to de-allocate the memory that we don't need anymore. Without freeing, it will cause a memory leak (memory on the heap will still be set aside and won't be available to other processes)

- Unlike the stack, the heap doesn't have a variable size restriction. The only thing that would limit the heap is the physical limitations of the computer
- Heap memory is slightly slower to be read from and written to, because you have to to use pointers to access memory on the heap

- Unlike the stack, variables created on the heap are accessible by any function, anywhere in your program. Heap variables are essentially global in scope

- If we need variables like arrays and structs that can change size dynamically such as arrays that can grow or shrink as needed, then we will need to allocate them on the heap using dynamic memory allocation functions (to manage that memory manually)

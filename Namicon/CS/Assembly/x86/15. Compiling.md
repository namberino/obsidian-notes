- test.c:
```c
int main(void)
{
	return 0;
}
```

- To compile this file: 
![](../Assets/test.c-compile.jpg)

- This will create an **exit.o** file (a binary object file) and **exit** which is the binary executable file

- If we want to convert the program to assembly code (output an **exit.s** file):
![](../Assets/test.c-compile-asm.jpg)
- The -S switch will create comparable AT&T Syntax Assembly source code
- The -m32 will create a 32-bit executable
- The -O0 will tell the compiler how much optimization to use when compiling the binary
- Numeric 0 means no optimization (meaning it is at the most human readable instruction set)

- exit.s file

- We then need to compile the Assembly source code into a binary object file which will generate a **exit.o** file:
![](../Assets/test.c-asm-compile.jpg)

- Finally, use a linker to create the actual binary executable code from the binary object file which will create an executable called **exit**:

- objdump of the AT&T assembly program:

- GDB on **test**:

- **Note**: The AT&T syntax is utilized more in Linux

- Difference in syntax:
	- AT&T syntax: **movl %esp, %ebp** (This means move esp into ebp)
	- Intel syntax: **mov esp, ebp** (This means move ebp into esp)

- Pure assembly program that does the same thing as above:

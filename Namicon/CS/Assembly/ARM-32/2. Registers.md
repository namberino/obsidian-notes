- ARM microprocessor has internal storage that make any operation much faster as there is no external memory access needed
- There are two modes: User and Thumb 
	- User mode is for developing for a SoC within a Linux OS
	- Thumb mode is for bare-metal stuff (better suited for microcontrollers)

- In User mode, we have 16 registers and a CPSR register (32-bit or 8-bit each)
- Registers R0 - R12 are multi-purpose registers (General purpose register - GPR) to which R13 – R15 have a unique purpose as well as the CPSR
	- R13: Stack pointer
	- R14: Link register
	- R15: Program counter
	- CPSR: Current Program Status Register

- R0 – R12 are general purpose and will be used to manipulate data as we build our programs and additionally when we are hacking apart or reverse engineering binaries from a hex dump on a cell phone or other ARM device

- The chip we are working with is known as a load and store machine (meaning we can load a register with the contents of a register or memory location and we can store a register with the contents of a memory or register location)
- Example: 
```assembly
ldr, r4, [r10] @ 
    load r4 with the contents of r10, if r10 had the decimal value of 
    say 22, 22 would go to r4

str, r9, [r4] @ 
    store r9 contents into location in r4, if r9 had 0x02 hex, 
    0x02 would be stored into location r4
```
- The **@** simply indicates to the compiler that what follows it on a given line is a comment and to be ignored

- The PC (Program counter) is responsible for directing the CPU to the instruction that will be executed next
- PC holds the address of the instruction to be fetched next
- When coding we can refer to the PC as the R15 register (If you set it wrong, you can crash the executable)

- Example:
```assembly
mov r15, 0x00000000
```

- Regarding our ARM processor, we follow the standard calling convention, meaning params are passed by placing the param values into regs R0 â€“ R3 before calling the subroutine and the subroutine returns a value by putting it in R0 before returning

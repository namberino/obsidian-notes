- ARM is a load and store machine where the ALU (Arithmetic logic unit) only operates on the registers themselves and any data that needs to be stored out to RAM
- The control unit moves the data between memory and the registers which share the same data bus

- The CPU chip of this architecture holds a control unit and the ALU (along with some local memory) and the main memory is in the form of RAM sticks located on the motherboard
- A stored-program digital computer is one that keeps its program instructions, as well as its data, in read-write, or RAM.

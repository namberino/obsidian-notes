# Program
- Program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	int myNumber = 16;
	int myNewNumber = ++myNumber;
	
	std::cout << myNewNumber << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

- Pre-increment: The variable is incremented before assigning it to another variable
- **myNumber** is **16**, it gets incremented before being assigned to **myNewNumber** so we get **17**

# Debugging
- Debugging with GDB:

- At `main+24` we are moving the value of **1** into **r3**
- At `main+28` we are storing that value at **r11-8**

# Hacking
- Do the same thing as the debugging section, and then after breaking `main+28` and continuing, we set **r3** to something else:

- The link register (R14) is used to hold the return address of a function call
- When a BL (branch with link) instruction performs a subroutine call, the link register is set to the subroutine return address
- BL jumps to another location in the code and when completed, allows a return to the point right after the BL code section. When the subroutine returns, the link register returns the address back to the program counter

- The link register does not require the writes and reads of the memory containing the stack which can save a considerable percentage of execution time with repeated calls of small subroutines

- When BL has executed, the return address which is the address of the next instruction to be executed, is loaded into the LR or R14
- When the subroutine has finished, the LR is copied directly to the PC (Program Counter) or R15 and code execution continues where it was prior in the sequential code source

- Example:
![[link-reg.jpg]]
- Start and proceed to the **no_return** subroutine and proceed to the **my_function** subroutine then to the **wrap_up** subroutine and finally **exit**

- Compile: 
```bash
as lr_demo.s -o lr_demo.o
ld lr_demo.o -o lr_demo.o
```

- Using: A Raspberry Pi
- As soon as the Pi receives power, the graphic processor is the first thing to run as the processor is held in a reset state and the GPU starts executing code
- The ROM reads from the SD card and reads **bootcode.bin** (which gets loaded into memory) in C2 cache and turns on the rest of the RAM, **start.elf** then loads
- The **start.elf** is an OS for the graphics processor. It reads **config.txt** which you can modify. The **kernel.img** then gets loaded into **0x8000** in memory which is the Linux kernel
- Once loaded, **kernel.img** turns on the CPU and starts running at **0x8000** in memory

- If we wanted, we could create our own **kernel.img** that we can hard code machine code into a file and replace the original image and then reboot (ARM word size is 32 bit long, going from bit 0 to 31)
- When **kernel.img** is loaded the first byte, which is 8-bits, is loaded into address **0x8000**

- Example: 
In the hex editor (save this file into kernel.img then boot, this is a bare-metal firmware):
```assembly
FE FF FF EA
```

When the Pi boots, the **kernel.img** loads this:
```assembly
FE FF FF EA

@ address 0x8000, 0xfe gets loaded
@ address 0x8001, 0xff gets loaded
@ address 0x8002, 0xff gets loaded
@ address 0x8003, 0xea gets loaded
```
This set of commands executes an infinite loop

The above code has 3 parts to it:
1) Conditional – Set to always
2) Op code – Branch
3) Offset – How far to move within the current location

> **Condition – bits 31-28: 0xe or 1110**
> **Op Code – bits 27-24: 0xa or 1010**
> **Offset – bits 23-0 -2**

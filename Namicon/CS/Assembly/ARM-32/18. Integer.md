# Program
- A 32-bit register can store 2^32 different values
- The range of integer values that can be stored in 32 bits depends on the integer representation used
- The range 0 - 4,294,967,295 (2^32 − 1) is for an (unsigned) binary number
- The range −2,147,483,648 (−2^31) - 2,147,483,647 (2^31 − 1) is for two's complement (signed)
- With 32-bit memory addresses, we can directly access a maximum of 4 GB of byte-addressable memory

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	int myNumber = 777;
	
	std::cout << myNumber << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

# Debugging
- Debugging with GDB:
![[int-gdb.jpg]]
- We see at `main+12` **0x10730**'s data is being loaded  into **r3**

# Hacking
- We do the same thing as in the debugging section except before we continue, we change the value at **0x10730**:

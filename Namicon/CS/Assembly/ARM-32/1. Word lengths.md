- The system on chip we are working with has a 32-bit ARM CPU. 32-bits is actually 4 bytes of information which make up a word (as oppose to x86 Assembly where a word was 16-bits)
- The most significant bit of a word for ARM CPU is located at bit 31 therefore a carry is generated if an overflow occurs there
- The lowest address in our architecture starts at 0x00000000 and goes to 0xFFFFFFFF. The processor sees memory in word blocks therefore every 4 bytes
- A memory address associated with the start of a word is referred to as a word boundary and is divisible by 4. For example:
```assembly
0x00000000
0x00000004
0x00000008
0x0000000C
```

- There is the concept of fetching and executing where the processor deals with instructions. It must work in this fashion for proper execution

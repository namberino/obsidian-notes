- The CPSR register stores information about the program and the results of a particular operation
- Bits that are in the respective registers have pre-assigned conditions that are tested for an occurrence which are flags

- There are 32-bit in this register. The 4 that we concern with most are:
	- Bit 31 – N = Negative flag
	- Bit 30 – Z = Zero flag
	- Bit 29 – C = Carry flag (UNSIGNED OPERATIONS)
	- Bit 28 – V = Overflow flag (SIGNED OPERATIONS)
- When the instruction completes, the CPSR can get updated if it falls into one of the aforementioned scenarios. If one of the conditions occurs, a 1 goes into the respective bits

- There are 2 instructions that directly affect the CPSR flags: CMP and CMN
- CMP is compare:
```assembly
CMP R1, R0 @ notational subtraction where R1 – R0 and if the result is 0, bit 30 - Z would be set to 1
```
- The most logical command that usually follows is BEQ = branch if equal, meaning if the zero flag was set, the program branches to another label within the code
- If 2 operands are equal, the result is 0

- CMN makes the same comparison as CMP but the with the second operand negated:
```assembly
CMN R1, R0 @ R1 - (-R0) or R1 + R0
```

- When dealing with the SUB command, the result would NOT update the CPSR and you would have to use the SUBS command to make any flag update respectively

# Program
- Program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	int myNumber = 16;
	int myNewNumber = --myNumber;
	
	std::cout << myNewNumber << std::endl;
	std::cout << myNumber << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
}
```

Next 2 parts is basically the same as the pre-increment part (break after **r1** has been set)

- When the computer boots it needs to enable the *A-20* line
- In early architectures, processors had 20 address lines which were A-0 to A-19 that could access 2^20 bytes of information
- The *A-20* line is an external memory reference containing a 16-bit offset address added to a 16-bit segmented number which shifts 4 bits to get the additional access

- This process, combined with the GDT (Global descriptor table), allows you to work with your control register to to execute a far jump to enter protected mode (which is 32-bits)

- Long mode (64-bit mode), which we are all familiar with in our modern architectures, extend the address space to access **0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF**

- The data segment allocates memory on the heap rather than the stack as they are not local variables (they are known throughout the entire binary)
- The sizes of data are as follow:
	1) byte:Â We use the db notation which is 1 byte or 8 bits
	2) word: We use dw which is 2 bytes long
	3) double word: We use dd to assign and they are 4 bytes long
	4) quad word: We use dq which is 8 bytes long
	5) xmm word: We use xmmword which is 16 bytes long
	6) ymm word: We use ymmword which is 32 bytes long

- There are SSE math registers which are separate from the CPU has the following:
	1) real4: This is a single floating point number as this is 4 bytes long
	2) real8: This is a double floating point number as this is 8 bytes long

- Finally, there are arrays which can be single or multidimensional arrays where you can allocate with a db, dw, dd, dq, xmmword or ymmword

- The stack (local vars) grows down in memory so they start at a high memory address and grows down
- The heap (global vars) grows from a lower memory address and grows up

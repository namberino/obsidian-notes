# The boot sector
- At the very core of a computer booting is the boot loader. The boot loader physically reads the first sector (sector 0) from the hard drive or other media to bootstrap an OS
- When the computer boots, it reads the first sector (exactly 0x200 bytes hex or 512 bytes in decimal)
- The system that is reading this boot loader is referred to as BIOS which is a basic input output system and it loads in 16-bit mode
- It does this to be compatible with older processors. Modern processors immediately switch to what we refer to as UEFI which is a more sophisticated IO system

# Programming the boot sector
- Program:
```assembly
loop:
	jmp loop
```
- Compile: `nasm -f bin program.asm -o program.bin`

- The assembly instructions above will get translated down to their raw opcode values
- The processor only understands raw opcodes (operation codes)

- *Opcodes table*: http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html

- Program in Ghex:
![[jmp-ghex.png]]
- We see **EB FE** which are hex bytes and each letter is a nibble (4 bits or half a byte). Both **EB FE** make up 2 full bytes
- The processor reads from disk in reverse byte order such that **FE** gets read first then **EB** (little endian)
- From the table, **FE** represents an **INC** (increment by one) and this is our loop value. **EB** represents **JMP**

- Add a number to program:
```assembly
loop:
	jmp loop

db 0x10
```
- The hex number and will match our binary upon inspection

- Ghex:
![[ghex-hex.png]]
- The 3rd byte is 10 in hex and 16 in decimal

- Add a string to program:
```assembly
loop:
	jmp loop

db 0x10
db 'Welcome to the machine'
```

- Ghex: 
![[ghex-string.png]]
- We can see our original program in the first 3 bytes, the new bytes are hex numbers (representing ASCII characters - example: 0x57 in ASCII is 'W')
- *ASCII table*: https://condor.depaul.edu/sjost/it236/documents/ascii.htm

- Add padding algorithm to program:
```assembly
loop:
	jmp loop

db 0x10
db 'Welcome to the machine'

times 0x1fe-($-$$) db 0
dw 0xaa55
```
- This padding algorithm examines how many bytes are left after subtracting with 200h (512 in decimal), then it pads the remaining bytes with zeros
- **0xaa55** is a magic number that is a signature that the cpu is looking for to identify a boot sector (this code is at sector 0 when it boots and there is no file system so if it finds the successful signature it will attempt to boot it)

- Ghex:
![[boot-ghex.png]]
![[boot-ghex-2.png]]
- It pads out the remaining bytes up to 200h or 512 with 0's
- At the very end we have **55 AA**. When it goes into the CPU it reverses the byte order (little endian)

# Emulating the boot sector
- Using **qemu-system-x86_64**, we can boot the simple OS:
![[boot-qemu.png]]
- It does nothing but an infinite loop jump. However this is the most basic x86 OS one can create

# Memory in the boot sector
- How memory is allocated in the boot sector:
	1) **0x0 - Interrupt vector table**: This is where the interrupt table exists, at the very base of memory. This is where all of our interrupt calls exists
	2) **0x400 - BIOS data area**: This stores variables about the state of the bootable device
	3) **0x7c00 - Loaded boot sector**: This stores the machine code that will be loaded into RAM by the bootloader firmware (firmware is simply code that runs before an OS runs)
	4) **0x7e00 - Free**: This is the stack area where we can use for development
	5) **0x9fc00 - Extended BIOS data area**: Holds data from disk track buffers and other connected devices as there is no file system yet
	6) **0xa0000 - Video memory**: BIOS maps the video memory here at boot
	7) **0xc0000 - BIOS**: Where BIOS resides
	8) **0x100000 - Free**: Additional space we can use for development

# Set video mode and accept digits
- Program (boot up, set video mode, accept numeric digits in console):
```assembly
[org 0x7c00]              ; jmp origin of mapped boot sector code

mov bp, 0xffff            ; set the stack base
mov sp, bp                ; set the top of the stack to base

call set_video_mode

call get_char_input

jmp $                     ; infinite loop so CPU doesn't exec random code

set_video_mode:
	mov al, 0x03          ; 80x25 8x8 640x200 16 gray
	mov ah, 0x00
	int 0x10
	ret

get_char_input:
	xor ah, ah            ; wait for a character
	int 0x16
	
	cmp al, 0x30          ; compare to numeric 0
	jl get_char_input     ; jmp if less and restart loop
	cmp al, 0x39          ; compare to numeric 9
	jg get_char_input     ; jmp if greater and restart loop
	
	mov ah, 0x0e
	int 0x10
	
	jmp get_char_input    ; restart internal subroutine

times 0x1fe-($-$$) db 0
dw 0xaa55
```

- The first thing we do is move to the programable area of the boot sector code at address **0x7c00**
- We then set the stack base and identify the area for our stack and set the base pointer into the stack pointer
- Then we call our video mode function where we set a *640x200* greyscale console
- Then we call the get character input function that will only allow digits 0-9 (0x30 is the hex ASCII value for 0 and 0x39 is the hex ASCII value of 9)
- If the user types anything else in the console nothing will enter into the console

- Output:

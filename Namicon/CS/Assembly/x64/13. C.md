# Hello world
- Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello World\n");
	
	return 0;
}
```

- In Radare 2:
![[hello-c-r2.png]]
![[hello-c-r2-2.png]]

- **push rbp**: push the value currently in the base pointer onto the stack
- **lea rdi, qword str.Hello_World**: load the effective address of the quad word of the string into the **rdi** register
- **call sym.imp.puts**: The compiler optimizes the code and the compiler chose the **puts** function in the stdio library to echo the string to our terminal
- We clean out **eax** and pop the original value in the **rbp** register back into **rbp**

- Note: change 2005 to 2004 (too lazy to take new pic)

# Variables
- Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	char a = 'a';
	int b = 1;
	double c = 1.1;
	
	printf("char a = %c\n", a);
	printf("int b = %d\n", b);
	printf("double c = %f\n", c);
	
	return 0;
}
```

- Debugging:
![[var-r2.png]]
![[var-r2-2.png]]

- We see 3 variable declarations defined up at the top in reverse order as they are **local_1h** which is our **char a,** **local_8h** which is our **int b** and **local_10h** which is our **double c**
- The **rbp** base pointer allocate space for these variables

- Within memory at **0x0000113d** we see the instructions **mov byte [local1_h], 0x61** which is in our ascii table a lowercase '**a**'
- We know that `[local1_h]` is not real code. However these variables are pushed onto the stack in reverse order above. In reality the code at the mapped memory address of **0x0000113d**  is really **mov byte [rbp-0x1], 0x61**
- If we change the code to something like **mov byte [rbp-0x1], 0x62**, we just changed **a** to **b**:

# Branches
- Program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a = 1;
	
	if (a == 1)
		printf("A is 1\n");
	else
		printf("A is not 1\n");
	
	return 0;
}
```

- Debugging:
![[branch-r2.png]]

- The branching logic is pointed to by aqua arrows
- At **0x0000114a** we see our first branch being loaded into **rdi**. At **0x00001148** we see a **jne 0x1158** (jump if not equal)
- At **0x00001158** we see our second branch being loaded into **rdi**
- **1** being compared to what is in **local_4h** which is pseudo code for what is actually in **rbp-0x4**

- We can change **jne** to **je** to change the output:

# Pointers
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int number = 777;
	int* pNum = &number;
	
	printf("Address \t Variable name \t\t Value\n");
	printf("%p \t %s \t %d\n", pNum, "Number", number);
	
	return 0;
}
```
- *Note*: The memory the pointer is pointing to and the memory of the pointer is different

- Array:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int number = 777;
	int numArr[3] = {4, 2, 3}
	
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
		printf("numArr[%d] \t %p \t %d\n", i, &numArr[i], numArr[i]);
	
	return 0;
}
```

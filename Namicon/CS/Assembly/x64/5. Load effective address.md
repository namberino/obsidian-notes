- When a binary executes in RAM the OS will un-map the code into a data segment where it finds free space in memory
- Load effective address loads a given memory address as a pointer to any given variable

- Example:
```assembly
lea rbx, my_var    ; load the address of my_var into rbx
```

- Every single byte is addressable
- Example:
```assembly
lea rax, my_var
inc rax
mov word ptr [rax], rbx
```
- Let’s say the value 0x20 is in **rbx**. This above instruction will place the value of 0x20 into a non-word boundary which will result in an error. You would have to increment **rax** by 2 to ensure that does not happen

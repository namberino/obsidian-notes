# OSI model (7 layers)
1) **Physical layer**: Raw electrical layer which read voltages on an ethernet cable or reading the Wi-Fi RF (radio frequencies). Protocols associated: USB, DSL, ISDN, Infrared, etc.
2) **Data link layer**: Deals with how a message between notes starts and ends called framing which has some error correction, detection and some flow control. Protocols associated: Ethernet, VLAN, etc.
3) **Network layer**: Transmits packets between nodes in different networks which involves routing. Protocols associated: IPX, NAT, ICMP, ARP, etc.
4) **Transport layer**: Reliably deliver data between two hosts which must split it up into chunks to send. Protocols associated: NetBIOS, TCP, UDP, etc.
5) **Session layer**: Adds checkpoint and resume in addition to term dialogues. Protocols associated: SMB, SOCKS, etc.
6) **Presentation layer**: Where data structure for and presentation for an application are created where we have encoding, serialization and encryption. Protocols associated: TLS, SSL, etc.
7) **Application layer**: Web browsers and apps that use web interfaces like email, etc. Protocols associated: DHCP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, SMTP, FTP, TELNET, etc.

- When we browse a website, we start at the physical layer and go to the app layer and as it hits the server it is at the app layer and goes back down to the physical layer and continue the cycle

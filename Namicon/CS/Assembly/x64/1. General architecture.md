- The x64 architecture is a backwards-compatible extension of the x86 platform
- It provides a legacy 32-bit mode, which is identical to x86, and a new 64-bit mode
- The term "x64" includes both AMD64 and Intel64. The instruction sets are similar

- x64 extends x86's 8 general-purpose registers to be 64-bit, and adds 8 new 64-bit registers
- The 64-bit registers have names beginning with "**r**", for example the 64-bit extension of **eax** is called **rax**. The new registers are named **r8** through **r15**
- The lower 32 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits of each register are directly addressable in operands. This includes registers, like **esi**, whose lower 8 bits were not previously addressable

- The assembly-language names for the lower portions of 64-bit registers (The table breaks out each bytes distinction):

- Operations that output to a 32-bit sub-register are automatically zero-extended to the entire 64-bit register
- Operations that output to 8-bit or 16-bit sub-registers are NOT zero-extended (this is a compatible x86 behavior)

- The high 8 bits of **ax**, **bx**, **cx**, and **dx** are still addressable as **ah**, **bh**, **ch**, **dh**, but cannot be used with all types of operands
- The instruction pointer, **eip**, and **flags** register have been extended to 64 bits (**rip** and **rflags**, respectively) as well

- The x64 processor also provides several sets of floating-point registers:
	- Eight 80-bit x87 registers
	- Eight 64-bit MMX registers (These overlap with the x87 registers)
	- The original set of eight 128-bit SSE registers is increased to sixteen

- x64 utilizes the flat memory model where we have 1 large array of addresses that exist within the processor
- A pointer is the address of a specific value in memory

- Example:
```assembly
mov rax, 0x10            ; moving 0x10 (pointer) into the rax register
mov rbx, word ptr [rax]  ; move a word value pointed to by rax into rbx
mov word ptr [rax], 0x66 ; put value of 0x66 into the memory at 0x10
```
- Let’s assume the value inside memory **0x10** was **0x20** therefore **rax** points to the value inside **0x10** which when you dereference by **[rax]** contains **0x20**. **0x20** is the value inside of the register **rax**
- Third line will change the value inside **0x10** memory location (which was **0x20**) to **0x66**

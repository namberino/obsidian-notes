Gauss's Law: Tells us the charge through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface.

$$
\oint{\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A}} = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}
$$

Gauss's Law for Magnetism: Tells us we can't have a magnetic monopole.

$$
\oint{\vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}} = 0
$$

Ampere's Law: Tells us how running currents create curling magnetic fields.

$$
\oint{\vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l}} = \mu_0 I_{enc}
$$

Faraday's Law: Tells us how changing magnetic fields create voltage.

$$
\oint{(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) \cdot d\vec{l}} = - \frac{d\phi_B}{dt}
$$

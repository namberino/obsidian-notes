Power is the change in energy (the capacity to do work, $U = V q$) over change in time.

$$
P = \frac{dU}{dt}, \; U = \int{Pdt}
$$

We can get power by multiplying current (change in charge over change in time) and voltage (energy per unit of charge):

$$
\begin{align}
P = IV = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}
\\
P = \frac{Q}{t} \frac{U}{Q} = \frac{U}{t}
\end{align}
$$

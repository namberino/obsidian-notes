- Let's see how we can build a driver or module or a single source file in the kernel

- Compiling single source file:
```sh
make drivers/media/test-drivers/vimc/vimc-core.o
```

- Compiling directory:
```sh
make drivers/media/test-drivers/vimc/
```

- Note: Tristate driver: enabled as built-in, enabled as a module, disabled

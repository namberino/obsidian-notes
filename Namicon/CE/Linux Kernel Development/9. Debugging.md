- Ask the following questions when debugging:
	- Is the problem easily reproducible?
	- Is there a reproducer or test that can trigger the bug consistently?
	- Are there any panic, or error, or debug messages in the `dmesg` when the bug is triggered?
	- Is reproducing the problem time-sensitive?

- Easily reproducible bugs with a test to trigger make it easier to debug, identify the problem, fix it and verify the fix
- Time-sensitive problems could be a result of race conditions, and these are harder to debug and fix

- A kernel panic is an action taken by an operating system upon detecting an internal fatal error from which it cannot safely recover and force the system to do a controlled system hang / reboot due to a detected run-time system malfunction (not necessarily an OOPS)
- OOPS are due to the Kernel exception handler getting executed including macros such as `BUG()` which is defined as an invalid instruction

- Decode and analyze panic messages: 
	- Panic messages can be decoded using the [decode_stacktrace.sh](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh) tool.
	- You will have to supply the `[base path]`, which is the root of the git repo where the `vmlinux` resides if it is different from the location the tool is run from

```sh
Usage: scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh -r <release> | <vmlinux> [base path] [modules path]
```

```sh
scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh ./vmlinux < panic_trace.txt
```

- Use `/sys/kernel/debug` to debug

```sh
# Enable all events:  
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events  
echo 1 > enable
```

```sh
# Enable the skb events:  
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/skb  
echo 1 > enable
```

- Debugging tips:
	- Adding additional debug messages `pr_debug` or `dev_debug`) is a good way to gather information on a bug.
	- However, avoid adding additional messages and enabling event tracing when debugging a time-sensitive problem, as it can change the timing and could make it harder to reproduce the problem.

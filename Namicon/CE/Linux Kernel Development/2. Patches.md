- Changes to the kernel are normally called a "*patch*" after the name of the historical tool that works with incremental changes to a text file, likely originating in the patch used in stitching a quilt or mending a piece of clothing
- Patches are small incremental changes made to the kernel
- Each patch contains a change to the kernel that implements one independent modification that stands on its own
- A patch cannot break the kernel build
- Requiring each patch to do one thing makes it easier to isolate regressions; reverting a problem patch becomes easier as well. Complex changes to the kernel are thus split into smaller chunks

# Patch components
```sh
git format-patch -1 --pretty=fuller 3a38e874d70b
```

- **Commit ID**: The auto-generated SHA 1 hash is generated from a cryptographic hash function that has all the important information about the patch, such as the commit date, the committer's name and email address, the log message, and more. Changing any of the information associated with the Commit ID results in changing it. This makes it a tamperproof fast way to compare two commits using the IDs, and git pull requests become fast and efficient.
- **Commit header** (_major subsystem: minor area: short description of what is being changed_): As you can see in the example provided, the patch changes the **usbip_host** driver, which is a sub-driver of the **usbip** driver. This driver falls under the **drivers/usb** subsystem. The author of the patch writes this information in a standard format with ":" separating the major and minor subsystem fields. You will also see "/" as a separator, which would look like **usbip/usbip_host: cleanup do_rebind() return path** instead of **usbip: usbip_host: cleanup do_rebind() return path**. Using "/" or ":" is determined by the maintainer's preference. If in doubt, refer to a few patches for the subsystem for information on individual preferences
- **Commit log**: It provides a detailed description of the change and why the change is made. Alternate design choices if any are considered. Details about the testing done. The example we provided shows a small change and the commit log is simple and to the point. Commit logs can be long for patches that fix panics, as they include panic stack traces. We encourage you to take a look at a few commit logs in the kernel source repository to get a better understanding of the kind of information that is relevant to include in them
- **Author**: This component provides the author's name and email information. This information can be specified when you run **git commit** or it can be configured in your **.gitconfig** file, which is a very convenient way to generate commits. You can see an example of a **.gitconfig** file for author and email below. Please note that the email address in the **Signed-off-by** should match the email address you send patches from
- **AuthorDate**: Auto-generated commit time and date. This value comes from the system time of your computer when you create the change
- **Commit**: The committer's name and email address. The committer is a maintainer or developer that applies the patch to a git repository. This patch was picked up by the USB maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman and committed to the usb tree and tested prior to being included in a pull request from Greg KH to Linus Torvalds. Since it was pulled, you won't see Linus as the committer for this patch. If you look at the git log, you will see several merge commits from Linus for when he pulls subsystem trees from maintainers
- **CommitDate**: Auto-generated commit time and date when Greg KH applied this patch to the usb tree. You will notice that there is a difference of 19 days between the initial commit date and the commit date when the patch was applied to the usb tree. This is not unusual, depending on where things are in the release cycle. Merge windows and quiet periods could delay a patch from being applied
- **Signed-off-by**: Using sign-off, developers certify the patch to be their original work or have the right to pass it on as an open source patch. In our example, the author signed off and then, as the usb maintainer, Greg KH signed-off on the patch. Refer to [Sign your work - the Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin) for detailed information on this tag, as it is a very important part of the kernel development process

# Patch email
- How to prefix patch email subject line: 
	- The **[PATCH]** prefix is used to indicate that the email consists of a patch
	- **[PATCH RFC]** or **[RFC PATCH]** indicates the author is requesting comments on the patch
	- **[PATCH v4]** is used to indicate that the patch is the 4th version of this specific change that is being submitted

# Patch version history
- It is a requirement to include the patch version history when sending a re-worked patch
- The patch revision history on what changed between the current version and the previous version is added between the **“---”** and the **“start of the diff”** in the patch file
- Any text that is added here gets thrown away and will not be included in the commit when it is merged into the source tree
- Example description of what changed:
```
Changes since v3: Added null check for <variable name> as suggested by <name>
```

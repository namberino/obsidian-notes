- Basic testing: build and run kernel and check `dmesg` for any regressions
- As a general rule, there should be no new **crit**, **alert**, and **emerg** level messages in `dmesg`. There should be no new **err** level messages
```sh
dmesg -t -l emerg  
dmesg -t -l crit  
dmesg -t -l alert  
dmesg -t -l err  
dmesg -t -l warn  
dmesg -t -k  
dmesg -t
```

- Longer compile times could be indicators of performance regression in one of the kernel modules
- Performance problems are hard to debug
- Running several compiles in parallel is a good overall stress test that could be used as a performance regression test and overall kernel regression test (as it exercises various kernel modules like memory, filesystems, dma, and drivers)
```sh
time make all
```

- Enabling the following configuration option is recommended for testing your changes to the kernel:
```
CONFIG_KASAN  
CONFIG_KMSAN  
CONFIG_UBSAN  
CONFIG_LOCKDEP  
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING  
CONFIG_LOCKUP_DETECTOR
```

- Find all supported debug configuration options: `git grep -r DEBUG | grep Kconfig`

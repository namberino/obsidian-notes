- When there's a new release, there's a 2-week merge window 
- During this merge window, he pulls code for the next release from subsystem maintainers
- Subsystem maintainers send signed git pull requests to Linus either during the merge window or before
- All major new development is added to the kernel during the merge window. 10,000+ change sets (patches) get pulled into Linus's tree during these 2 weeks, at the end of which he releases the first release candidate, known as **rc1**
- At this point, the release cycle moves into a bug fixes-only mode, with a series of release candidate (**rc**) releases from Linus
- One week after **rc1** is released, **rc2** comes out; **rc3** comes out a week after, and so on, until all major bug fixes and regressions (if any) are resolved
- The new cycle begins with a 3-weekÂ _quiet period_, which starts a week before the release, and continues through the 2-week merge window. Maintainers and key contributors are busy getting their trees ready to send pull requests to Linus.

# Active kernel releases
- **Release Candidate (RC releases)**: mainline kernel pre-releases that are used for testing new features in the mainline (we will talk about mainline tree shortly). These releases must be compiled from source. Kernel developers test these releases for bugs and regressions.
- **Stable releases**: bug fix-only releases. After Linus releases a mainline kernel, it moves into stable mode. Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the mainline kernel and applied to stable git by a designated stable kernel release maintainer. Stable kernel updates are released on average, once a week, or on an as needed basis.
- **Long-term releases**: stable releases selected for long-term maintenance to provide critical bug fixes for older kernel trees.

# Kernel trees
- Mainline tree: This tree is maintained by Linus Torvalds. This is where Linus releases mainline kernels and RC releases
- Stable tree: This tree is maintained by Greg Kroah-Hartman. This tree consists of stable release branches. Stable releases are based on this tree.
- Linux-next tree: This is the integration tree maintained by Stephen Rothwell. Code from a large number of subsystem trees gets pulled into this tree periodically and then released for integration testing. The process of pulling changes from various trees catches merge conflicts (if any) between trees

# Subsystem maintainers
- Each major subsystem has its own tree and designated maintainer(s). Subsystems may have multiple maintainers

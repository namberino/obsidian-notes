## Internet layer model
- Application: Structured application data (HTTP, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, POP, IMAP)
- Transport: Data Integrity, packet splitting and reassembly (TCP, UDP)
- Internet: Routing (IP, IPv6, ICMP)
- Link: Physical, signals on wires (Ethernet, PPP, token ring)

## ISO OSI layer model
- Application: Structured application data (HTTP, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, POP, IMAP)
- Presentation: Encoding translation, encryption, compression (MIME, SSL/TLS, XDR)
- Session: Suspending, terminating, restarting sessions between computers (Sockets, TCP)
- Transport: Data Integrity, packet splitting and reassembly (TCP, UDP)
- Network: Routing (IP IPv6, ICMP)
- Data link: Encapsulation into frames (Ethernet, PPP, SLIP)
- Physical: Physical, signals on wires (Ethernet physical layer, DSL, ISDN)

> The Internet layer model is good for like 99% of the networking you'll ever do

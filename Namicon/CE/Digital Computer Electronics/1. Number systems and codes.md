# Binary odometer
- If binary numbers are used in a odometer, each kilometer will advance the units wheel by 1
- Whenever the units wheel runs out of digits, it resets and carries. This repeats for other wheels
- Computer circuits are like binary odometers, they count and work with binary numbers
- A string of 8 bits is called a *byte*

___
# Transistors
- Computers use *IC*s (Integrated circuits) with thousands of transistors (bipolar or MOS)
- Using only 2 points on the load line of each transistor (*two-state* design) allow the transistors to work well despite the transistor variations

- The common *two-state* design is the cutoff-saturation approach: each transistor is forced to operate at either cutoff or saturation
- When a transistor is cut off or saturated, parameter variations have almost no effect. Because of this, it's possible to design reliable two-state circuits that are almost independent of temperature change and transistor variations

___
# Transistor registers
- A register is a string of devices that store data

- Example of *two-state* design:
![[transistor-regs.png]]

- The transistors on the left are cut off because the input base voltages are $0V$ (Dark shading symbolizes cutoff condition). The transistors on the right have base drives of $5V$
- Transistors operate either at saturation or cutoff
	- $0V$: Cutoff
	- $5V$: Saturation
- Each transistor stays in a given state until the base voltage switches it to the opposite state

> *Two-state* operation is universal in digital electronics. Low voltage represents binary 0. High voltage represents binary 1

___
# Non-saturated circuits
- In most applications, the saturation delay time is too short to matter. But some applications require the fastest possible switching time
- To get this max speed, there are circuits that switch from cutoff (or near cutoff) to a higher point on the load line (short of saturation)
- These circuits rely on clamping diodes or heavy negative feedback to overcome transistor variations

___
# Microprocessors
## Computer
- There are 5 main sections inside a computer:
	- **Input**: Consists of all the circuits needed to get programs and data into the computer
	- **Memory**: Stores the program and data before the computer run begins (also can store partial solutions during a run)
	- **Control**: Directs the operation of all the other sections
	- **Arithmetic and Logic**: Crunches numbers and makes logical decisions (with control telling it what to do and memory feeding it data)
	- **Output**: Passes the processed data to the outside world

## Microprocessor
- The *control section* and the *ALU* are combined into 1 unit called the *Central Processing Unit* (*CPU*)
- It's also convenient to combine *input* and *output* into 1 unit called the *input/output unit* (*I/O unit*)
- Nowadays, CPUs are fabricated on a single chip called a *microprocessor* (same thing for the memory and I/O unit)

## Microcomputer
- This is a small computer that uses a microprocessor for its CPU
- A typical microcomputer has 3 kinds of chips: microprocessor (1 chip), memory (several chips), and I/O (1 or more chips)

___
# Hexadecimal
- Goes from 1-9 then A-F

## Memory location and addresses
- If a microprocessor has 64K memory (65536 memory locations), each is able to store 1 byte
- Each different location is identified by hex numbers called addresses
![[64k-memory-mapping.png]]

## Binary - Hex - Decimal equivalents
- A 64K memory has 65536 addresses from 0000 to FFFF (0000 0000 0000 0000 to 1111 1111 1111 1111 in binary)
- First 8 bits are called the upper byte (UB), Second 8 bits are called the lower byte (LB)

## BCD numbers
- A *nibble* is a string of 4 bits
- Binary-Coded-Decimal (*BCD*) numbers express each decimal digits as a nibble
- Example: $2945_{10}$ in BCD number
![[bcd-conversion.png]]
- And reverse the BCD conversion:
![[bcd-conversion-rev.png]]

- Conversion table:
![[bcd-conversion-table.png]]

> BCD numbers are useful whenever decimal information is transferred into or out of a digital system (like a calculator)

- BCD have limited value in computers. Because a computer has to do more than just crunching decimal information. It has to handle more than that (letters, numbers, other symbols)

___
# The ASCII code
- This is a 7-bit code whose format arrangement is (each X is either 0 or 1):
$$
X_6X_5X_4X_3X_2X_1X_0
$$

- Example: 'A' is encoded as (sometimes space is inserted for easier reading):
$$
1000001
$$

- ASCII table:
![[ascii-table.png]]

> *SP* stands for space

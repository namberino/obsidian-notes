# Logic gates
> Basic gates: NAND, NOT, AND, OR

## Boolean algebra
- Symbols:
	- NOT: $\overline{A}$
	- OR: $A+B$
	- AND: $A \cdot B$

- These are often called *decision-making elements* because they can recognize some input words while disregarding others

> Italic notation bits are ANDed and normal roman notation bits are just normal bits

Example truth table ($Y = AB + CD$)
![[bool-algebra-example-truth-table.png]]

- Example:
![[4-bit-decoder.png]]
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_1 = \overline{ABC} D \\
Y_2 = \overline{AB} C \overline{D} \\
Y_3 = \overline{AB} CD \\
Y_4 = \overline{A} B \overline{CD} \\
Y_5 = \overline{A} B \overline{C} D \\
Y_6 = \overline{A} B C \overline{D} \\
Y_7 = \overline{A} B C D \\
Y_8 = A \overline{BCD} \\
Y_9 = A \overline{BC} D
\end{aligned}
$$

- The above circuit is a binary-to-decimal decoder (converts binary to decimal)
- When a register contents are let's say 0011, $Y_3$ AND gate has all high inputs, therefore $Y_3$ is high and all other AND gates have at least 1 low input
- If the register contents change to 0100, only $Y_4$ has all high input
- The subscript of the high output equals the decimal equivalent of the binary number stored in the register

- Example: 1-of-16 decoder:
![[1-of-16-decoder.png]]
- The k-bit word formed by the 4 leftmost register bits is called the *OP CODE*:
$$
OPCODE = I_{15}I_{14}I_{13}I_{12}
$$

# More logic gates
> More gates: NOR, NAND, XOR, XNOR, multi-input gates

## De Morgan's first theorem
This NOR equation:
$$
Y = \overline{A+B}
$$
can be simplified to this:
$$
Y=\overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}
$$

![[de-morgan-first-theorem.png]]

So:
$$
\overline{A+B} = \overline{A} \cdot \overline{B}
$$

## De Morgan's second theorem
The NAND equation:
$$
Y = \overline{AB}
$$
can be simplified to this:
$$
Y = \overline{A} + \overline{B}
$$

![[de-morgan-second-theorem.png]]

So:
$$
\overline{AB} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}
$$

> Both theorems work for multiple inputs as well

## Exclusive-OR gate
XOR (broken down to AND and OR):
$$
Y = \overline{A}B + A\overline{B}
$$
or:
$$
Y = A \oplus B 
$$

### Four inputs:
$$
Y = (A \oplus B) \oplus (C \oplus D)
$$
![[4-input-xor.png]]

### For any inputs
It's the XOR sum of the inputs:
$$
Y = A \oplus B \oplus C \oplus ...
$$

> No matter how many inputs, XOR gates only recognizes words with an odd number of 1s

## Parity
- *Even parity*: A word has an even number of 1s
- *Odd parity*: A word has an odd number of 1s
- Example:
	- 1111 0000 1111 0011 (Even parity)
	- 1111 0000 1111 0111 (Odd parity)

- XOR gates are ideal for testing the parity of a word (since they only recognize words with an odd number of 1s)

- Odd parity tester:

- Odd parity generator:

## Controlled inverter
- A circuit that transmits a binary word or its *1's complement*

### The 1's complement
- Complement each bit (flip each bit) in a word and the new word is the 1's complement
- Example: 1100 0111 -> 0011 1000

### The controlled inverter circuit
- First let's check out this circuit:
![[xor-inverter.png]]
- When INVERT = 0: $Y = A$
- When INVERT = 1: $Y = \overline{A}$

- We can use this concept in a controlled inverter circuit:
![[controlled-inverter-circuit.png]]
- This circuit can transmit the register contents (the 1's complement) of the register contents

- When INVERT = 0: $Y_n = A_n$
- When INVERT = 1: $Y_n = \overline{A_n}$

## Word comparator
![[word-comparator.png]]
- This circuit compares and check whether the 2 register words are identical or not
